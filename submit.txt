Description:
PhotoFrameUploader is a minimalist companion app for uploading photos to a Waveshare ESP32-S3-PhotoPainter running the aitjcize/esp32-photoframe firmware. Pick a photo, upload it to your PhotoFrame, and optionally display it immediately. Albums can be browsed, created, and managed directly from the device.

The PhotoFrame must be on the same Wi-Fi network. The app connects only to the local device and does not send data to external servers.
